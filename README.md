# GraphQL for TKL

This is just me learning [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/).

I decided to learn GraphQL by providing an GraphQL API for existing REST API, namely 
the [Journey API](http://wiki.itsfactory.fi/index.php/Journeys_API) that provides 
information for [TKL](https://www.tampere.fi/tkl/) public transport services.

This application is implemented using [Clojure](https://clojure.org).
